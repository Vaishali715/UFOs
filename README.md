# UFOs
UFOs using Javascript, HTML and Bootstrap to make a UFO sighting's page.

## Overview of the project
For this project we are building an HTML page that will allow us to pull up information from a javascript data file using filters on the page. We want to use filters since we have many different sightings that occurred throughout the U.S. based on different areas or type of the shape of the sighting.

## Results
### HTML page

At our website we will see the main page with the title and picture at the top. As we scroll down, we will begin to see all the data and filters that we have.

### Filtering the data

![Image]()

As we can see, we have five different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country and shape. We can choose any of these filters and search the about the sightings, and the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search. Multiple filters can be entered at the same time to further inspect the data in the specific search bar that is entered.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

We have created a page that looks clean and allows the user to filter through the different sightings in our data set using the search bars created. Websites do have one or the other drawbacks and according to me this website has following drawbacks:
1. The searchbox criteria is case sensitive. It does not allow to filter if anything is written in the upper case as it takes only the lower case data.
2. If we search for the data that does not exist in our database, the website will not display anything.

### Recommendations for further development
1. For the above stated second drawback, we can add a dropdown list so that user can select from the given input and will always have some result. And also some more buttons could be added to clear the data in searchbox and for ENTER/RESULT.

2. Pagination could be added to give an organized look to the website.
